# Let's Do This - tech test

This is my attempt at the tech test for [Let's Do This](https://www.letsdothis.com/gb), which asked for an array of JSON objects containing booking data to be sorted into startlists for each race, along with functionality for each event organiser to see how much they've made in ticket sales.

For this I created a front-end application using React.js containing a search function that enables the user to filter a table of data by runner name, event, race title or organiser, returning a total for the ticket sales in each instance.

I also created dynamic routes for each runner containing some key information, and with more time I would like to have done this for each race and organisation. 

Ideally I would have created an in-depth admin panel with a dropdown selector for each organisation on the home page, providing them with an in-depth look at startlists for each race and a breakdown of ticket sales for each one.
